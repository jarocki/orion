"""Workspace/investigation isolation manager.

Each workspace is an independent SQLite database file. Switching workspaces
means switching which database file the session connects to. This mirrors
Metasploit's workspace model — investigations are fully isolated at the
storage layer.

@decision DEC-WS-001
@title One SQLite file per workspace, no shared database
@status accepted
@rationale Isolation by file makes workspaces trivially portable (copy the .db
           file), deletable (rm the file), and independently queryable. A shared
           database with a workspace_id discriminator column would require more
           complex queries and risks cross-workspace data leaks from missing WHERE
           clauses. SQLite's file-per-database model is the right fit.

@decision DEC-WS-002
@title Active workspace tracked in memory only (no persistence file)
@status accepted
@rationale The active workspace is a session concept, not a persistent preference.
           Persisting it to a file adds complexity without user value -- the console
           always starts in the configured default_workspace (from ConfigManager).
           A future "ap workspace switch" command updates ConfigManager, not a
           separate state file.

@decision DEC-WS-003
@title store_stix_objects accepts both plain dicts and python-stix2 objects
@status accepted
@rationale The production call chain sends plain dicts from module.hunt(). But
           helper functions (create_ipv4 etc.) return python-stix2 objects. Both
           forms must be accepted so callers don't need to pre-convert. Detection
           logic: if the object has a .serialize() method, it's a stix2 object;
           otherwise treat it as a dict and pass through dict_to_stix.

@decision DEC-WS-004
@title Deduplication by STIX ID using ORM session.get() before insert
@status accepted
@rationale STIX SCO IDs are deterministic (content-based). The same observable
           stored twice has the same ID. Using session.get(Model, pk) before
           inserting leverages the SQLAlchemy identity map (O(1) for already-seen
           objects in the same session) and fires Python-side column defaults
           (created_at). Raw SQL INSERT OR IGNORE was attempted but silently dropped
           rows because the NOT NULL created_at column has no SQLite-level DEFAULT.

@decision DEC-WS-005
@title get_workspace_stats uses multiple scalar queries, not a single aggregation join
@status accepted
@rationale Each stat (total_indicators, domain_count, ip_count, module_run_count,
           total_score, note_count) requires a different query against different tables
           or filtered subsets. A single UNION or CTE would be harder to read, debug,
           and extend. SQLite is fast for small workspace databases (< 100k rows), so
           6 small scalar queries run in negligible time. Clarity over micro-optimization.

# @decision DEC-WORKSPACE-DB-001
# @title Confirmation lives at UI surface only — WorkspaceManager.clear() is unconditional
# @status accepted
# @rationale The manager is a data-layer authority (Sacred Practice 12: single authority per
#            state domain). Embedding a confirm_token parameter on clear() would create a
#            second policy gate inside the data layer, duplicating the UI-surface gate and
#            violating the single-responsibility contract. The cmd2 and chat surfaces own
#            user interaction; the manager owns data mutation.

# @decision DEC-WORKSPACE-DB-002
# @title Workspace clear covers operational and epistemic data; schema receipt survives
# @status superseded
# @rationale v0.8 adds sources, observations, questions, assertions, hypotheses,
#            evidence links, confidence, likelihood, and contradictions. Clear removes
#            all investigation content but preserves workspace_schema_version so an empty
#            workspace remains safely openable without repeating a migration.

# @decision DEC-WORKSPACE-DB-007
# @title Post-clear loud verification — RuntimeError if any table still has rows
# @status accepted
# @rationale Sacred Practice 5 (fail loudly and early, never silently). After committing
#            the bulk DELETE for all 6 tables, the manager re-queries each table and raises
#            RuntimeError if any count != 0. This catches partial-clear bugs (e.g., ORM
#            session not flushing, FK constraints preventing deletion) before the caller
#            reports success to the user.

# @decision DEC-WORKSPACE-TUI-NOTIFY-001
# @title notify_target_changed takes bus explicitly — no module-level singleton
# @status accepted
# @rationale Concern 2 (reviewer round 2): the previous _EVENT_BUS module-level
#   global created hidden state that persisted across tests and required an
#   explicit wire_event_bus(None) teardown call in every test that touched it.
#   Option B (reviewer recommendation): pass the bus explicitly as the first
#   parameter of notify_target_changed(). Callers that hold no bus reference
#   (e.g. APConsole._tui_bus = None before TUI activation) pass None and the
#   call is a no-op. This eliminates hidden state, makes test isolation automatic
#   (no module-level teardown required), and is self-documenting at the callsite.
#   Sacred Practice 12 (single authority per state domain): the bus reference is
#   owned by the TUI session (TuiApplication / _run_tui_chat), not by this module.

        response_sha256:
            SHA-256 hex digest of the raw vendor response bytes, computed by the

        @title Provenance fields added to json_blob AFTER obj.serialize()
        @status accepted
        @rationale obj.serialize() feeds the python-stix2 deterministic-id derivation.
                   Adding provenance before serialization would make the same observable
                   fetched at two different times produce two different STIX IDs, breaking
                   deduplication (DEC-WS-004). Post-serialization augmentation keeps the
                   ID stable: same SCO content → same ID, regardless of provenance.

        @decision DEC-59-STIX-PROVENANCE-004
        @title Legacy SCOs (no provenance kwargs) get x_ap_fetched_at defaulted to storage-time UTC
        @status accepted
        @rationale x_ap_fetched_at is the only provenance field that the workspace can
                   populate without module cooperation. The other three require the caller
                   to supply them. Defaulting fetched_at here ensures every SCO has at
                   least a storage timestamp, making the minimum provenance record non-null.

    def clear(self, name: str | None = None) -> dict[str, int]:
        """Clear all data tables in the named workspace (or active if None).

        Deletes the clear-managed operational, epistemic, document, proposal,
        and snapshot records plus the workspace's raw-document content store.
        The SQLite file, schema, schema-version receipt, framework-mapping
        records, and external-integration execution receipts are preserved.

        Sentinel rows stored in ``score_events`` (``_milestone_sentinel``,
        ``_dossier_state_snapshot``, ``_predictions_log``) are cleared by
        intentional side effect — "clear workspace data" is a dossier-state
        clear (DEC-WORKSPACE-DB-002).

        The ``clear()`` method is unconditional — confirmation gates live at
        the UI surface only (cmd2 ``_workspace_clear`` / chat workspace handler).
        There is no ``confirm_token`` parameter (DEC-WORKSPACE-DB-001).

        After committing the bulk DELETEs, every clear-managed table and the
        raw-document content path are verified absent or empty. Any incomplete
        cleanup raises ``RuntimeError`` without issuing a success receipt
        (DEC-WORKSPACE-DB-007, Sacred Practice 5 — loud failure over silent
        fallback).

        Parameters
        ----------
        name:
            Workspace name to clear. If ``None``, the active workspace is used.

        Returns
        -------
        dict[str, int]
            Counts of rows deleted per clear-managed table plus the number of
            raw document files removed under ``raw_document_files``.

        Raises
        ------
        RuntimeError
            If ``name`` is ``None`` and no workspace is active.
        ValueError
            If ``name`` is given but does not exist.
        RuntimeError
            If post-clear verification finds any data table still non-empty.
