"""AP module tools for the agent framework.

Each tool wraps an existing PursuitModule, handling initialization,
execution, result formatting, and workspace storage.

@decision DEC-AGENT-TOOLS-001
@title Thin tool wrappers delegating to existing PursuitModule infrastructure
@status accepted
@rationale The existing modules (whois, dns, abuseipdb, shodan, hibp, otx, urlscan,
           virustotal, censys_host, passivetotal) are already tested and working.
           Tool wrappers are thin adapters that: (1) accept simple string args
           from the LLM, (2) initialize the module with config, (3) call hunt(),
           (4) format + store results. No business logic duplication.

@decision DEC-AGENT-GRAPH-EXPORT-001
@title render_graph and export_workspace as stateless per-call RelationshipGraph builds
@status accepted
@rationale RelationshipGraph is a lightweight in-memory object (DEC-GRAPH-001). Building
           it fresh on each render_graph/export_workspace call avoids any staleness issue
           (graph always reflects current workspace state), eliminates session-lifecycle
           complexity, and mirrors exactly how console.py do_graph and do_export work:
           both construct a new RelationshipGraph(), call build_from_workspace(raw_objects),
           then render/export. Caching would require invalidation logic with no benefit
           given graph builds are O(n) on a small CTI workspace. The two tools are
           registered as LLM tools (OpenAI function-calling format, DEC-AGENT-TOOLS-002)
           and also exposed as chat meta-commands in chat.py (mirroring the cmd2 pattern
           of DEC-AGENT-HINTS-001 and DEC-AGENT-AUTOPIVOT-001).

@decision DEC-AGENT-TOOLS-002
@title OpenAI function-calling format for tool definitions
@status accepted
@rationale The OpenAI function-calling schema (list of {type, function: {name,
           description, parameters}}) is now the de facto standard. litellm
           passes this format to every supported LLM provider, translating as
           needed. By producing tool definitions in this format, the tool layer
           is compatible with any litellm-supported backend (Ollama, OpenAI,
           Anthropic, etc.) without changes.

@decision DEC-AGENT-TOOLS-003
@title Per-module credential builders for multi-key auth modules
@status accepted
@rationale Most modules use a single api_key, but Censys requires censys_id +
           censys_secret and PassiveTotal requires passivetotal_user +
           passivetotal_key. _CREDENTIAL_BUILDERS maps module paths to callables
           that construct the full init_config dict from ConfigManager. Modules
           not in the map fall back to the legacy {"api_key": ...} pattern.
           This keeps run_module() generic while correctly threading multi-key
           credentials to modules that need them.

@decision DEC-AGENT-HINTS-001
@title HintProvider wired into ToolContext; both chat meta-command and LLM tools exposed
@status accepted
@rationale Two integration paths are provided for hints in the agent:
           (1) Chat meta-command ('hint', 'hint <module>', 'hint buy [<module>]') in
           chat.py mirrors cmd2's do_hint — gives the analyst immediate access without
           involving the LLM at all. Handled in the local meta-command dispatch before
           any LLM call so it is fast, deterministic, and not subject to LLM refusal.
           (2) LLM tools 'get_next_hint' and 'buy_hint' let the LLM proactively offer
           hints when it detects the analyst is stuck or requests a suggestion. Both
           paths share the SAME HintProvider instance on ToolContext so the revealed-ID
           set (DEC-HINT-002) is consistent regardless of which path surfaced a hint.
           Balance protection (DEC-HINT-001): buy_hint reads get_total_score() before
           calling HintProvider.buy_hint(). On InsufficientBalanceError the cost is
           NOT deducted and an error string is returned — score never goes negative.
           Score deduction for paid hints uses workspace_mgr.store_score_events() with
           a negative points entry, exactly as documented in DEC-HINT-001 and the
           HintProvider docstring. The HintProvider itself is stateless about the
           workspace — the caller (this module and chat.py) owns deduction.

@decision DEC-AGENT-AUTOPIVOT-001
@title EventBus auto-pivot integrated into ToolContext; opt-in via autopivot_enabled flag
@status accepted
@rationale The cmd2 console (APConsole) has no autopivot integration yet — this is the
           first wiring of EventBus.process_results into an execution path. The agent
           tool path is the right place because:
           (1) Opt-in by default (DEC-EVENTBUS-002): autopivot_enabled=False on
               ToolContext. Analysts enable it explicitly via 'autopivot on' in the
               chat meta-command, mirroring the cmd2 pattern where it is a toggle.
           (2) EventBus.process_results is the canonical cascade workhorse. After
               run_module() produces STIX results, process_results() publishes each
               STIX indicator as a PivotEvent which triggers all subscribed module
               callbacks for that STIX type. Cascaded results are collected and
               merged into the tool response summary so the LLM and user both see
               what fired secondarily.
           (3) Depth limit deferred to PivotConfig.max_depth (default=2, DEC-EVENTBUS-001).
               Module whitelist deferred to PivotConfig.module_whitelist. Both are
               respected transparently by EventBus.publish() — the tool layer does not
               duplicate that logic.
           (4) Async bridge: run_module() uses asyncio.run() for each async call
               sequentially (not nested). After asyncio.run(mod.hunt()) returns, a
               second asyncio.run(event_bus.process_results()) starts a fresh event
               loop — valid in Python 3.12+ when calls are sequential.
           (5) Module subscriptions: DEFAULT_SUBSCRIPTIONS maps module_path → stix_types.
               Each entry is registered via event_bus.register_module_subscriptions()
               with a per-module callback that initialises and runs that module's
               hunt() for the pivoted indicator value.

@decision DEC-AGENT-CHALLENGES-001
@title ChallengeManager wired into ToolContext; list_challenges + check_challenges LLM tools
@status accepted
@rationale ChallengeManager is session-scoped (DEC-CHALLENGE-002: in-memory state).
           Wiring it into ToolContext (parallel to BadgeManager, HintProvider) means
           both the LLM tool path and the chat meta-command path share one instance
           so challenge completion state is consistent regardless of which code path
           checks it.

           Two LLM tools are exposed:
           (1) list_challenges() — returns active/all challenges as serializable dicts
               via ChallengeManager.list_challenges(). No side-effects. The LLM can
               call this at session start to announce what challenges are available.
           (2) check_challenges() — runs ChallengeManager.check_all(workspace_data)
               against the current workspace state and returns newly-completed challenges.
               The workspace_data dict is assembled here using the same keys as
               APConsole._build_workspace_data() (DEC-CHALLENGE-001): stix_type_counts,
               modules_used, total_score, total_indicators, indicators.

           Auto-check after every run_module() call (mirrors APConsole._check_challenges_after_run):
           After badges are checked, build workspace_data from WorkspaceManager and call
           check_all(). Newly-completed challenges are appended to the run_module summary
           and returned under the "challenges" key so execute_tool/chat.py can render
           them as Rich panels. A session-scoped set _announced_challenges prevents the
           same challenge from appearing in the summary more than once (parallel to
           _awarded_badges for badges).

           The chat meta-command 'challenges' lists all challenges in a Rich Table,
           mirroring APConsole.do_challenges() exactly — same column layout.

           Modules_used tracking: WorkspaceManager.get_module_runs() is already called
           for workspace summary; here we reuse it to build modules_used as a list of
           module_name strings from get_module_runs(), matching how APConsole builds
           _build_workspace_data(). This is the identical strategy, not a new mechanism.

@decision DEC-M8-CLEANUP-002
@title generate_dossier_report is the sole report LLM tool; classic interview tools removed
@status accepted
@rationale DEC-68-DOSSIER-REFRAME-008 one-release deprecation runway expired at M-8.
           start_report_interview, answer_report_question, and generate_report (classic
           interview path) are deleted. generate_dossier_report becomes parameterless.
           Tool count drops from 31 to 28. No interview state on ToolContext.

        @title CelebrationEngine wired into run_module return value
        @status accepted
        @rationale The cmd2 console renders celebrations in _execute_hunt() after
                   scoring. The agent path must surface the same visual feedback to
                   users. Rather than rendering inside run_module (which has no
                   console reference), the celebration string is computed here and
                   returned under the "celebration" key so the caller (execute_tool,
                   chat.py REPL) can render it at the appropriate display boundary.
                   Keeping computation in run_module means tests can assert the
                   artifact without mocking the Rich console.
                   Silent path: celebration is None when total_points == 0 (no
                   scoring events), matching the cmd2 path which only shows
                   celebration when scoring_events is non-empty.
                   Milestone messages are computed against the post-storage total
                   score and appended to the celebration string when they fire.

        @decision DEC-AGENT-BADGES-001
        @title BadgeManager wired into run_module after scoring, mirroring cmd2 _check_badges_after_run
        @status accepted
        @rationale cmd2 APConsole._check_badges_after_run() calls BadgeManager.check_all()
                   after each module execution, persists newly-earned badge events via
                   workspace_mgr.store_badge_event(), and renders a Rich panel per badge.
                   The agent path mirrors this exactly: (1) build already_awarded from the
                   workspace using get_awarded_badges() on first check then from the session
                   cache _awarded_badges thereafter for dedup; (2) call check_all() against
                   get_workspace_stats(); (3) persist via store_badge_event(); (4) return the
                   newly-earned Badge list under "badges" key so execute_tool can thread it
                   to chat.py for Rich panel rendering.
                   Silent path: badges is [] when no new badges earned, matching cmd2
                   behaviour which only renders panels when newly_earned is non-empty.
                   _awarded_badges set is seeded lazily from the workspace on first call
                   so sessions that resume mid-investigation do not re-award old badges.

        @decision DEC-AGENT-MODES-001
        @title ModeManager wired into ToolContext; mode affects celebration text and LLM persona
        @status accepted
        @rationale Three integration points for character modes in the agent path:
                   (1) ToolContext holds a ModeManager instance (parallel to BadgeManager,
                   CelebrationEngine) so mode state is scoped to the agent session, not
                   imported as a global — matches cmd2 APConsole.mode_mgr pattern.
                   (2) run_module celebration: CelebrationEngine produces the ASCII art;
                   mode_mgr.active.score_celebration.format(points=total) appends the
                   mode-specific points line, mirroring console.py _execute_hunt() which
                   uses the same template call. The field is named 'personality' on
                   CharacterMode (not 'persona_prompt' as the plan draft said).
                   (3) LLM persona: AgentRunner.set_character(mode) prepends mode.personality
                   to the default system prompt. chat.py 'mode <name>' meta-command calls
                   ModeManager.switch(name) then runner.set_character(active_mode) so the
                   LLM voice changes immediately without resetting conversation history beyond
                   the system message slot (conversation[0]).

        Parameters
        ----------
        module_path:
            Canonical module path, e.g. "osint/abuseipdb".
        target:
            The target string (IP, domain, URL, email) to hunt.
        options:
            Optional options dict passed to hunt(). Defaults to {}.
            Special key: ``dry_run`` (bool, default False) — when True,
            evaluate pivot policy gates but do NOT invoke cascade callbacks.

        Returns
        -------
        dict with keys:
            results (list[dict]): raw hunt() output
            score_events (list[dict]): scoring events generated
            total_points (int): total points awarded
            summary (str): human-readable summary for the LLM
            celebration (str | None): ASCII art celebration string, or None
                when no points were awarded (silent path).

    This is the dispatcher that maps LLM tool call names to module invocations.
    The summary string is suitable for inclusion in the LLM conversation as a

    terminal (None when no points were awarded — silent path). The badges list
    contains newly-earned Badge objects for Rich panel rendering in chat.py

    @decision DEC-AGENT-BADGES-001
    (see run_module docstring for full rationale)
    Four-tuple return chosen over a unified user_messages list because
    celebration (plain string), badges (Badge objects with rarity metadata for
    styled panels), and challenges (Challenge objects) all have different
    rendering logic at the chat.py boundary. Keeping them as separate typed
    values preserves testability and avoids conflating distinct display
    artifacts into an untyped list.

    @decision DEC-64-LLM-PANEL-SEPARATION-001
    @title Strip gamification text from LLM-facing summary; surface via sidecar typed fields
    @status accepted
    @rationale The LLM receives summary as a tool result and narrates it to the user.
               Badge/challenge award text in summary caused double-narration: the LLM would
               announce the award *and* chat.py Rich Panels would show it again. F64 removes
               badge/challenge lines from summary. challenges is now the fourth element of the
               return tuple so chat.py can render challenge panels independently of the LLM.

    ----------
    ctx:
        The shared ToolContext providing workspace, modules, and scoring.
    tool_name:
        Name of the tool to execute (matches names in create_tools()).
    arguments:
        Dict of arguments from the LLM tool call.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[str, str | None, list, list]
        (summary, celebration, badges, challenges) where summary is the
        LLM-facing result string (findings only — no badge/challenge text),
        celebration is the ASCII art to display to the user or None, badges is
        a list of newly-earned Badge objects ([] when none), and challenges is
        a list of newly-completed Challenge objects ([] when none).
        Returns (error_string, None, [], []) when the tool fails — errors are

    @rationale DEC-64-LLM-PANEL-SEPARATION-001: the LLM tool path must return

    M-4 extension: reads persistent DossierState snapshot when present; falls back
    to fresh inference when no snapshot exists yet (DEC-M4-PERSIST-001). The
    Predictions slot status is overlaid from the persisted predictions log.

    The function:
    1. Attempts to load persisted DossierState from sentinel row.
    2. Falls back to fresh infer_dossier_state_full() when no snapshot exists.
    3. Applies predictions overlay in both paths (DEC-M4-PERSIST-001 / plan §4).
