"""Agent runner for conversational CTI interface.

Manages the LLM interaction loop: user message → tool calls → response.
Supports multiple LLM backends via litellm.

@decision DEC-AGENT-RUNNER-001
@title litellm for LLM backend abstraction instead of direct smolagents
@status accepted
@rationale litellm provides a unified interface to 100+ LLM providers (local
           Ollama/vLLM, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) with OpenAI-compatible
           function-calling. This gives users maximum flexibility in choosing
           their LLM backend. smolagents' CodeAgent approach is powerful but
           adds complexity; the simpler tool-calling pattern via litellm is
           sufficient for AP's needs and easier to test.

@decision DEC-AGENT-RUNNER-002
@title Graceful ImportError when litellm not installed
@status accepted
@rationale litellm is in [project.optional-dependencies.agent], not core deps.
           The tool layer (tools.py) must work without it. AgentRunner raises
           a clear ImportError at .chat() time (not import time) so the module
           can always be imported and instantiated — the error only surfaces
           when the user actually tries to chat. This pattern matches how
           optional features are handled throughout the codebase.

@decision DEC-RUNNER-CONVERSATION-INTEGRITY-001
@title Conversation-transactional per-tool_call block + torn-history healing
@status accepted
@rationale Two production bugs surfaced immediately after Slice 6 landed:
           (1) _hook.set_activity raised AttributeError (LivePane did not
           implement _StatusHook). The assistant tool_call message was already
           committed to self.conversation before the hook call raised, leaving
           history torn: an assistant tool_call with no matching tool_result.
           The next user turn sent OpenAI a malformed conversation and litellm
           rejected it with BadRequestError about orphaned tool_call_ids.
           Fix has two independent layers:
           Layer A — _safe_hook_call: hook is best-effort UI state; any
           exception from a hook method is swallowed with a debug log so the
           runner always proceeds to execute the tool regardless of UI errors.
           Layer B — per-tool_call finally block: even if Layer A is bypassed
           or a future bug is introduced, the finally clause guarantees a
           tool_result is appended for every tc.id before any exception can
           propagate. If the tool itself raises, a synthetic error result is
           emitted so the LLM can see the error and possibly recover; the
           conversation is always well-formed.
           Additionally, _heal_torn_history() runs at chat() entry and repairs
           any pre-existing torn history from a previous interrupted session,
           so operators who already hit the crash do not need to restart.

# @status accepted
# @rationale runner.py must not import Rich directly — it is a library module

#            StatusBar from banner.py satisfy the interface without a hard import.
#            NullStatusHook (_NULL_STATUS_HOOK singleton) is the default so every
#            call site in chat() is unconditional — no "if status_bar is not None"
#            guards scattered across the hot path. Sacred Practice 12: one authority
#            (PHRASES via StatusBar.set_activity) and one call pattern.
#            The slug-mapping helper (_status_slug_for_tool) is colocated with the
#            wiring so future tool additions only require one dict update, not
#            two separate files.

        ------
