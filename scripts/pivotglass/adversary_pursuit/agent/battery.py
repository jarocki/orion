"""Battery — deterministic ordered tool dispatch for the TUI.

A Battery is a frozen configuration object that groups a set of tools,
a target dossier slot, and a set of applicable target types. BatteryRun
executes a battery against a concrete target, firing typed events on the
shared EventBus and honouring yield commands received mid-flight.

@decision DEC-BATTERY-DISPATCH-001
@title deterministic dispatch, not LLM-driven
@status accepted
@rationale Batteries execute tools in a fixed, declared order. This makes
           the analyst's experience predictable (the same battery always
           runs the same tools in the same sequence) and makes the system
           testable without an LLM in the loop. The LLM is consulted for
           investigation strategy (what to pursue next), not for tool
           ordering inside an already-dispatched battery.

class Battery:
    """Immutable configuration object for a named tool battery.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name:
        Canonical battery identifier (e.g. "identity_battery").
    tools:
        Ordered tuple of tool names to execute. For the ``synthesis_battery``
        sentinel this is an empty tuple — dispatch fires an LLM synthesis call
        instead of tool calls (C-11: batteries deterministic, LLM synthesizes).
    target_slots:
        Tuple of dossier slots this battery contributes evidence for.
        A battery is dispatched when ANY of its target_slots is not yet FILLED
        (or dossier_state is None). Multi-slot batteries (e.g. reputation covers
        TTPs + CAPABILITY; behavioral covers TIMING + TARGETING) satisfy C-3:
        every slot must have at least one battery that can contribute evidence.
    applies_to:
        Tuple of STIX SCO type strings this battery is valid for.
        Used by dispatch_batteries() in battery_registry.py to filter.
        For the synthesis_battery sentinel, this is ("__any__",) meaning
        it matches all target types once sufficient tool-driven slots are filled.
    hypothesis_hint:
        Short description of what the battery is trying to establish.
        Shown in the live pane when the battery starts.
