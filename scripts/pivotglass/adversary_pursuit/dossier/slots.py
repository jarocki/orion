"""Dossier slot schema v1.0 — vocabulary, weights, status enum, and M-2 scaffold types.

This module is the SOLE authority for the 9-slot vocabulary and per-slot
importance weights defined in the Phase 16 strategic scoping record.

@decision DEC-M1-DOSSIER-002
@title 9-slot vocabulary unchanged; status enum widened to {empty, partial, filled, deferred}
@status accepted
@rationale DEC-68-DOSSIER-REFRAME-010 grants M-1 a ±2-slot refinement window.
    This module exercises that window conservatively: the 9-slot vocabulary is
    unchanged from Phase 16 §3. The presentational status enum adds 'deferred'
    to signal that a slot exists in the v2 vocabulary but its inference path
    lands in a later milestone (M-2 / M-4 / M-5). 'deferred' is NOT a schema
    mutation — it is a read-side status value that is reversible at the per-slot
    level when M-2 lands. Further vocabulary changes require a planner re-stage
    and a successor DEC-ID.

@decision DEC-M1-SLOTS-WEIGHT-AUTHORITY-001
@title SLOT_WEIGHTS is the single source of truth for per-slot importance weights
@status accepted
@rationale Sacred Practice 12. The Phase 16 §3 table defines weights
    (Identity=5.0, Predictions=4.0, Capability=3.5, TTPs=3.0, Motivation=3.0,
    Targeting=2.5, Denial=2.5, Infrastructure=2.0, Timing=2.0). Any change to
    weights requires M-3 Evaluation Contract and a successor DEC-ID; they must
    not be adjusted in M-1. The SLOT_WEIGHTS dict lives here and is the only
    place weights are defined — callers import from this module.

@decision DEC-M2-DOSSIER-004
@title PredictionRecord / DenialStrategyRecord are typed scaffold dataclasses; always DEFERRED in M-2
@status accepted
@rationale M-2 ships typed shapes for slot 8 (Predictions Log) and slot 9
    (Denial/Deception Strategies). The actual inference for these slots is deferred
    to M-4 (persistent prediction records) and M-5 (user-note surface). Having typed
    dataclasses here (a) gives callers a concrete import surface now, (b) prevents
    future implementers from inventing incompatible shapes, and (c) is testable
    without any new persistence. Both dataclasses use field(default_factory=list)
    for list fields to avoid mutable default argument problems (PEP 557).
