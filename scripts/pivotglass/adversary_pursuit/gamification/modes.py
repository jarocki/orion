"""Character modes for Adversary Pursuit.

Each mode is a configuration profile that affects prompt style, celebration
messages, and run success/failure voice.

The active mode is managed via ModeManager and consulted by APConsole for:
- prompt prefix (do_back, do_use restore mode-aware prompt)
- run/hunt success and failure messages (_execute_hunt)
- score celebration template (formatted with points= kwarg)

Character v2 (C-1 MVP, Phase 17B):
  LLMPersonaProfile is an additive frozen dataclass that carries the per-mode
  LLM voice profile for modes upgraded in C-1..C-4. CharacterMode gains an
  optional llm_profile field (default None). When set, AgentRunner.set_character
  injects it into the system prompt. The five Rich-panel-voice fields remain the
  sole authority for their surfaces (run_fail, greeting, etc.) — the LLM profile
  is consulted only by the agent path.

@decision DEC-MODE-001
@title CharacterMode as frozen dataclass, ModeManager as thin state machine
@status accepted
@rationale CharacterMode instances are pure configuration — they carry no
           mutable state and are looked up by name. A frozen dataclass is the
           right primitive: immutable, self-documenting, and serializable.
           ModeManager wraps a dict copy of DEFAULT_MODES so tests can mutate
           the manager state without affecting the module-level defaults.
           APConsole holds a single ModeManager; mode switches are reflected
           immediately in prompt and subsequent command output.

@decision DEC-MODE-002
@title score_celebration uses str.format(points=N) — not f-string interpolation
@status accepted
@rationale The score_celebration string is stored as data (not code), so it
           must be evaluated lazily at runtime. {points} is a named placeholder
           that callers format with .format(points=total). This keeps the
           template strings readable as data and avoids eval(). Callers are
           responsible for the format call — they know the point total.

@decision DEC-62-KILL-DOC-LIES-001
@title Delete hint_style (zero consumers, undefined semantics); rewrite personality
@status accepted
@rationale hint_style was added speculatively in Phase 3 planning but never wired
           to any hint subsystem. It has zero consumers and its values ("speed bonuses",
           "combo multipliers", "chaos mode") are false advertising — the feature does
           not exist. Deleting the field removes a documentation lie without any
           behavioural change. personality strings that referenced unimplemented mechanics
           ("speed bonuses", "combo multipliers", "random pivot suggestions") are rewritten
           to describe what the mode actually does: its voice, tone, and message style.
           run_fail is now the single authority for failure voice (DEC-62-KILL-DOC-LIES-001);
           _MODE_TITLE_FLAVORS in error_interpreter.py (F61 drift) is deleted in the same
           change so there is never a parallel authority for mode-error phrasing.

@decision DEC-C1-FULLTROLL-002
@title Schema: CharacterMode.llm_profile: LLMPersonaProfile | None = None
@status accepted
@rationale Compatible field addition under DEC-MODE-001 (frozen-dataclass discipline
           preserved). Default None means every existing mode continues to behave
           exactly as F62 — no code changes needed for the 9 non-upgraded modes.
           LLMPersonaProfile is a frozen dataclass mirroring CharacterMode's discipline.
           The None-default path is the F62-behavior path verbatim; set_character in
           runner.py preserves the v1 string composition when llm_profile is None.

@decision DEC-C1-FULLTROLL-001
@title full_troll LLMPersonaProfile content (verbatim per MASTER_PLAN Phase 17B)

@rationale Extends full_troll's existing F62 Rich-panel snark (run_success="GET REKT
           ADVERSARY!", run_fail="BRUH. Even my grandma...") into the LLM chat surface
           without inventing a new persona. forbidden_voice mechanically blocks F64
           "+N points" smuggling at the prompt level. tool_preferences uses affinity
           language ("feels like") not instruction language ("prefer") to satisfy
           DEC-30-CHARACTER-V2-005 alongside the persona-swap test. context_hooks is
           empty (DEC-C1-FULLTROLL-005: deferred until #68 M-4 lands dossier state).

@rationale Extends bureaucrat's static TPS-report idiom into the LLM chat surface.
           Policy §/Form-number framing is the heaviest idiom load of the three C-3
           personas; token trim applied (4 signature_phrases, 2 forbidden_voice, short

@title columbo LLMPersonaProfile content (DEC-C4-COLUMBO-001 / Phase 17M)
@status accepted
@rationale Extends columbo's existing F62 "just one more thing" rumpled-detective
           templates into the LLM chat surface. This is the FIRST non-empty
           context_hooks in the v2 catalog (DEC-C4-COLUMBO-103): three conditional-
           hint strings referencing real M-4 dossier slot vocabulary (DossierSlotName
           + SlotStatus enum values as STRING LITERALS — no import of dossier modules).
           The runner.py composer already joins context_hooks with "; " at line 379
           (DEC-C2-NINJA-002 inheritance through C-3 to C-4 — runner.py BYTEWISE
           UNCHANGED). Token budget verified ≤165 (trim-path steps 1-5+8 applied:
           3 signature_phrases, 2 forbidden_voice, short dialect_cadence, 1
           tool_preference). fourth_wall_stance="opaque" (DEC-C4-COLUMBO-006):
           columbo IS the detective. voice-affinity tool_preferences only
           (DEC-30-CHARACTER-V2-005; persona-swap test gates this invariant).

@decision DEC-C4-COLUMBO-101
@title drunken_master/chuck_norris/bobby_hill reclassified UPGRADE → terminal KEEP_STATIC
@status accepted
@rationale No usage pattern asks for tier-1 LLM personas. v1-carrier test path
           (drunken_master, tests/test_character_v2.py:388 + tests/test_agent_tools.py:
           1597-1651) stays intact by leaving drunken_master at llm_profile=None.
           Disposition supersedes DEC-30-CHARACTER-V2-002 for these three modes.
           TestTierOneModesPermanentlyStatic enforces as permanent invariant.
           CLOSES the v2 character roadmap (no C-5).

@decision DEC-C4-COLUMBO-102
@title mastery_level hook RETIRED PERMANENTLY (supersedes DEC-30-CHARACTER-V2-004)
@status accepted
@rationale C-1/C-2/C-3 shipped without mastery_level. DEC-68-DOSSIER-REFRAME-005
           retired XP-grind; a per-mode integer that goes up over sessions is
           functionally equivalent to score-grinding regardless of framing.
           Sacred Practice 12 (single source of truth): adding mastery_level
           would introduce a second persona-depth axis parallel to the 8-field
           voice schema. No core/persona_mastery.py created.
           test_mastery_level_not_present docstring updated to RETIRED PERMANENTLY
           as the permanent invariant gate.

@decision DEC-C4-COLUMBO-103
@title context_hooks convention: "when slot '<slot_id>' is <status>: '<voice line>'"
@status accepted
@rationale Schema stays at C-1's tuple[str, ...] (no schema refinement — window
           closed at C-1 per DEC-30-CHARACTER-V2-003). The conditional-hint convention
           uses DossierSlotName enum values and SlotStatus enum values as string
           literals; the LLM reads the strings as natural-language guidance. No
           condition-execution — the LLM reads "when slot 'identity' is empty" as a
           hint about WHEN to use the voice line. TestColumboDossierAwareContextHooks
           enforces that each hook references a real slot name and status value.

@decision DEC-C4-COLUMBO-104
@title 5 existing v2 personas keep context_hooks=() — no retrofit
@status accepted
@rationale full_troll/ninja/sun_tzu/bruce_lee/bureaucrat keep context_hooks=()
           because their voices don't pivot off dossier case-state knowledge.
           Adding generic dossier hooks to them would force re-validation of 5
           byte-stable C-1/C-2/C-3 profiles — gratuitous churn. Minimal-codebase
           principle: add the surface where motivated. columbo establishes the
           pattern; future slices have a clear template if demand arises.

@decision DEC-C4-COLUMBO-006
@title columbo fourth_wall_stance="opaque" (mirrors DEC-C2-NINJA-001/DEC-C3-PHILOSOPHY-006)
@status accepted
@rationale columbo IS the detective (Peter Falk in a rumpled trenchcoat, not an LLM
           playing him). The "I'm probably just confused" deflection is in-character
           humility, not LLM-self-awareness. Meta-awareness would cheapen the register.
           Established as valid value by C-2, re-applied by C-3, inherited by C-4.

@decision DEC-DRUNKEN-MASTER-DEPRECATED-002
@title drunken_master remains selectable while visibly deprecated
@status accepted (supersedes DEC-DRUNKEN-MASTER-RETIRED-001 removal semantics)
@rationale The operator requested deprecation, not deletion. Phase 18 Slice 5 incorrectly
           interpreted deprecation as removal and replaced the persona with default mode.
           Restoring the original static persona preserves user choice and project history
           without expanding its LLM prompt footprint: llm_profile remains None.

@decision DEC-CHAR-NEUROMANCER-001
@title neuromancer CharacterMode + LLMPersonaProfile (Phase 18 Slice 7A)
@status accepted
@rationale Gibson-cyberpunk deck-jockey voice — urgent second-person, matrix jargon,
           noir-tech staccato register. The operator IS Case; neuromancer IS the
           narrator/Wintermute. Modeled on Neuromancer (1984) dialect: short-clause
           sentences, present-tense observations, "Case," interjection weighted ~30%.
           Avatar 🌆 (Chiba city skyline — the canonical novel mood-setter) chosen by
           operator directive Phase 18 Slice 7A planning. fourth_wall_stance="opaque":
           neuromancer IS the voice from the matrix, not an LLM acknowledging the persona.
           tool_preferences use affinity language only per DEC-30-CHARACTER-V2-005.
           forbidden_voice blocks second-person break and jargon explanation as cardinal
           register violations. context_hooks=() per established C-4 pattern (deferred to
           a future slice where dossier slot states would add value). Token budget verified
           ≤165 (4-chars-per-token heuristic). Carries a non-None LLMPersonaProfile for
           full v2 LLM persona injection via AgentRunner.set_character (DEC-C1-FULLTROLL-003).

@decision DEC-CHAR-DECKARD-001
@title deckard CharacterMode + LLMPersonaProfile (Phase 18 Slice 5)
@status accepted
@rationale Film-noir detective voice — terse, laconic, world-weary present-tense monologue.
           Adds a high-contrast CTI character alongside the philosophical (sun_tzu, bruce_lee)
           and procedural (bureaucrat, columbo) archetypes. fourth_wall_stance="opaque":
           Deckard IS the replicant hunter. tool_preferences use affinity language per
           DEC-30-CHARACTER-V2-005. forbidden_voice blocks Blade Runner quote smuggling.
           token budget verified <= 165. Carries a non-None LLMPersonaProfile (weary,
           laconic, understated, cool) with five signature_phrases and three tool_preferences
           — full v2 LLM persona injection via AgentRunner.set_character (DEC-C1-FULLTROLL-003).

@decision DEC-CHAR-TRINITY-001
@title trinity Matrix-operator mode with White Rabbit prompt identity
@status accepted
@rationale Trinity adds a controlled, kinetic operator voice suited to threat hunting:
           concise direction, signal-over-noise judgment, and forward motion without
           reckless certainty. The White Rabbit emoji is the operator-selected identity.
           fourth_wall_stance="opaque": Trinity is the operator inside the system, not
           an assistant discussing a film persona. Tool preferences remain voice-affinity
           language and the scoring panel remains the sole point-total authority.
