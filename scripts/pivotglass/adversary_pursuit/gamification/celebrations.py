"""Celebration system — ASCII art and milestone messages for achievements.

Provides visual celebrations when analysts discover indicators, reach
score milestones, or earn their first discovery in a workspace.

@decision DEC-CELEBRATION-001
@title Four-level ASCII art system keyed on points earned per action
@status accepted
@rationale Points earned in a single run determine celebration intensity:
           small (<50), medium (50-199), large (200-499), epic (500+).
           This maps naturally to the scoring rules — a single IP discovery
           (100pts base) gets medium, a campaign description (1000pts) gets epic.
           ASCII art is randomized within each level to avoid repetition.

@decision DEC-CELEBRATION-002
@title Exact-threshold milestone fire — milestones triggered only at exact score match
@status superseded
@rationale Superseded by DEC-63-MILESTONE-CATCHUP-001 (cross-threshold + idempotency).
           Original rationale: milestones (First Century, etc.) fired only at exact
           thresholds — jumping 99→105 silently skipped First Century forever.
           DEC-63 replaced this with cross-threshold checks and a last_milestone_announced
           sentinel persistence. See MASTER_PLAN.md Phase 12C for the supersession record.

@decision DEC-63-MILESTONE-CATCHUP-001
@title Cross-threshold milestone semantics with idempotent last_announced sentinel
@status accepted
@rationale DEC-CELEBRATION-002 (exact-score-only check) is superseded. The old
           design silently skipped milestones when a run's points jumped past a
           threshold (e.g. score went 80 → 620 in one run — the 100 and 500
           milestones were never announced). The new design uses check_milestones()
           which evaluates ALL milestones in ascending order and returns every
           milestone whose threshold <= total_score AND whose id > last_announced.
           The caller persists last_announced via WorkspaceManager.set_last_milestone_id()
           so the check is idempotent across calls — a milestone never fires twice.
           Milestones are stored as a list[MilestoneSpec] with stable integer IDs so
           WorkspaceManager can persist a single integer sentinel (no schema change).
           Quiet-start migration: callers with an existing score and null
           last_announced_id should initialise last_announced_id to the highest
           already-crossed milestone (suppresses retroactive announcements that
           would lie about WHEN milestones were earned). See DEC-63-MIGRATION-001.
