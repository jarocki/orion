"""Parabolic decay scoring engine (CTFd model).

Formula: value = ((minimum - initial) / decay^2) * solve_count^2 + initial

Points decrease as more analysts find the same indicator (dynamic scoring).
For v1, solve_count tracks how many times the same STIX type has been discovered
in the current workspace.

@decision DEC-SCORING-001
@title CTFd parabolic decay formula for dynamic scoring
@status accepted
@rationale Proven formula from CTFd that self-balances difficulty valuation.
           Common indicators (IPs) lose value as more are found. Rare discoveries
           (campaigns, tools) maintain high value. The three parameters (initial,
           minimum, decay) are configurable per action type. The formula is clamped
           to [minimum, initial] to prevent underflow or negative points.

@decision DEC-SCORING-002
@title solve_count uses per-STIX-type workspace counts, not per-indicator counts
@status accepted
@rationale Counting per-indicator (e.g., this exact IP) would never decay — each
           new IP would always score at initial. Counting per-type (all IPs in
           workspace) models the real game mechanic: as you accumulate more of a
           type, each additional discovery is worth less. This incentivizes pivot
           diversity (finding new types) over depth (more of the same type).

@decision DEC-63-STREAK-SCORE-001
@title streak_continued ScoreEvent with three-tier step decay; prevents farming
@status accepted
@rationale A flat per-day bonus would be farmable (many short sessions to keep
           a streak running). Three tiers (10pts days 1-7, 5pts days 8-30, 2pts
           day 31+) reward early streak building but plateau quickly so grinding
           the streak for points becomes uneconomical. current_streak is the post-
           update value returned by StreakManager.update() (StreakUpdate.current_streak).
           Callers emit the event only when StreakUpdate.incremented=True so same-day
           idempotency and backward-clock clamp paths produce no event.
           StreakManager remains the sole ~/.ap/streak.json authority (DEC-62-STREAK-001);
           this file only defines the scoring calculation.
