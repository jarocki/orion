"""Hint System for Adversary Pursuit (Issue #18).

Provides contextual hints to help analysts when they're stuck. Hints are
divided into free (cost=0) and paid (cost=10-20 points). General hints
apply to all modules; module-specific hints apply to a loaded module.

@decision DEC-HINT-001
@title Hint cost is a score penalty, not a currency field
@status accepted
@rationale Analysts earn points through module runs. Hints consume points
           as an explicit trade-off: knowledge at the cost of score. The
           cost is applied by APConsole via WorkspaceManager.store_score_events()
           with a negative point value. HintProvider is stateless about the
           workspace — it only returns the cost to pay. The caller owns
           deduction and persistence. This mirrors DEC-BADGE-001 (pure data
           producers, stateless about persistence).

@decision DEC-HINT-002
@title Hints are revealed sequentially, tracked by ID set in HintProvider
@status accepted
@rationale Revealed hint IDs are tracked in HintProvider._revealed so the
           same hint is not shown twice. The HintProvider instance is held
           by APConsole (session-scoped), so revealed set resets on each new
           session. For v1, session-scoped tracking is sufficient; workspace
           persistence of revealed hints can be added in v2.

@decision DEC-HINT-003
@title get_next_hint returns free hints before paid hints
@status accepted
@rationale Ordering by cost ascending means analysts always see free hints
           first. Within the same cost tier, hints are presented in definition
           order. Module-specific hints are interleaved with general hints
           in cost order. This ensures the best UX: no accidental score penalty
           for hints the analyst could have gotten for free.

@decision DEC-HINT-004
@title Module-specific hints use module base name (not full path)
@status accepted
@rationale Modules are loaded by path (e.g. "osint/abuseipdb") but hints
           are keyed by base name (e.g. "abuseipdb"). APConsole strips the
           prefix when calling HintProvider methods. This keeps hint definitions
           readable and independent of the module namespace layout, which may
           change in v2 when additional module types are added.
